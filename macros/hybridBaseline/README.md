# Hybrid detector silicon baseline

This folder contains the GDML files for the silicon parts of the hybrid detector baseline.

It has 5 silicon barrel layers, consisting of 3 vertexing layers and 2 outer layers. The vertexing layers have a material budget of 0.05% X/X0 per layer, and the outer layers have 0.55% X/X0 per layer.

The disks are in a tapered configuration for the innermost two, hitting full available radius at the third disk. The material thickness for the disks is 0.24% X/X0.

To get a display of this configuration:
